"""Windows route + DNS manipulation for TUN-mode setup.

All operations need admin privileges.

For route add/delete the module talks straight to `CreateIpForwardEntry` /
`DeleteIpForwardEntry` in iphlpapi.dll via ctypes. Each call is ~100 µs;
the older `route add` shell route was ~10 ms per call. With ~9 k bypass
routes for the full geoip:ru list, that's the difference between 1 second
and 90 seconds at connect time.

Session pattern: callers build up a list of routes/DNS changes through
RouteSession, then `restore()` undoes them all at disconnect (or atexit if
the app crashes).
