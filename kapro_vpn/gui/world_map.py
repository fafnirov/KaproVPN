"""Tiny world map widget — shows where the active VPN exit is.

Drawn entirely in QPainter — no SVG file, no QtSvg dep, no bundled
image asset. Continents are hand-crafted polygons in (lat, lon) space,
projected to widget pixels via equirectangular projection. Pin = filled
amber circle with a soft glow centered on the active country's
coordinates.

Why hand-crafted polygons instead of a real SVG:
  - SVG world maps from Wikipedia are 50-500 KB each, and we'd need
    two (dark + light themes have different ocean/land colors), or
    QPainter recolor tricks. Adds binary weight + complexity for what's
    a 400×140 px decorative widget.
  - Hand polygons let us live-recolor by just passing palette colors
    to setBrush() each paintEvent — instant theme support.
  - Geographic accuracy doesn't matter at this scale — the user has
    a country flag and city name in the UI already; the map is for
    "ah that's roughly over there" recognition, not navigation.

Trade-off: continents are simplified to ~10-15 vertices each. Recognizable
silhouettes, but no fjord-level detail.
