"""Curated DNS choices exposed in Settings → DNS-сервер.

Why this exists: many subscription providers don't filter ads at the
DNS layer, so even through their VPN you see all the usual tracking
and banners. Picking AdGuard here gives you ad-blocking that follows
you to any server. Picking Cloudflare gives you a clean, fast resolver
in case your ISP serves slow/junk DNS. Picking Quad9 gives you malware-
domain filtering. System is the "leave it alone" default.

When a non-system option is active:

  - xray-core's own DNS block uses the DoH endpoint of the chosen
    service, so domain-based routing rules (e.g. `domain:sber.ru` →
    direct) resolve against that resolver, encrypted.
  - The chosen service's IPs are added to the routing "force direct
    by IP" set so any app that does its own DoH directly to those IPs
    (Yandex.Browser, modern Chrome) doesn't tunnel that traffic — same
    spirit as the existing DNS-leak hardening for common public
    resolvers added in v1.8.0.
  - In TUN mode the chosen service is also pinned on the TUN adapter
    via netsh/ip, AND its IPs go into the OS-level bypass-routes list
    so the DoH-over-port-443 round trip doesn't take a detour through
    the VPN server.

Adding a 5th option: add a new entry to OPTIONS plus translations in
the SettingsPage. xray_config and controller already iterate; no
wiring changes needed.
