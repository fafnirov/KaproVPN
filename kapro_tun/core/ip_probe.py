"""Fetch the public IP + country as seen from outside the machine.

Used after a successful connect to confirm in the UI that the tunnel
is actually active ("Ваш IP: 1.2.3.4 (Нидерланды)" — visible proof
that traffic is now egressing from the VPN server, not the user's ISP).

Privacy notes:

  - The probe goes through whatever route the system currently has set
    up. In HTTP-proxy mode we explicitly route it through our local
    SOCKS5 (127.0.0.1:2081) so it sees the VPN server's egress IP, not
    the local IP. In TUN mode all traffic already tunnels, no extra
    routing needed.
  - The endpoint is ipinfo.io — third-party, public, HTTPS. We send
    them an empty GET (no auth, no user identifier). They see "someone
    at IP X asked who they are" — same query a browser would make.
  - We don't log the result anywhere; it's shown in the UI and that's it.
  - User can disable this in Settings (kill switch for any "phone home"-
    looking call) via the `public_ip_probe` setting.

Timeouts kept tight (5s) because if it doesn't return fast, we'd rather
show nothing than make the UI feel sluggish.

    Why: KaproTUN's TUN mode only tunnels IPv4. On an IPv6-enabled host
    (typical Russian residential ISP — Beeline, MTS — gives clients
    public v6), Python's socket prefers AAAA records when both A and
    AAAA exist. The probe to ipify/ipinfo/ifconfig then resolves via
    AAAA → goes out over IPv6 → bypasses the TUN entirely → returns
    the user's REAL public IPv6 from their ISP, not the VPN server's
    IPv4. v1.10.2 user reported exactly this — UI showed
    `2a00:1370:...` (real Beeline v6) with country "Россия · Moscow".

    Forcing AF_INET in getaddrinfo means only A records are returned,
    only IPv4 connections are attempted. The probe then correctly
    sees the VPN server's egress IPv4.

    Monkey-patching socket.getaddrinfo is normally a red flag, but
