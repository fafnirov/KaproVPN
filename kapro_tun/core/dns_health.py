"""DNS reachability probe for TUN mode.

In TUN mode with DNS-leak protection the physical NIC's DNS is cleared, so
*every* name lookup has to travel through the tunnel's DNS path. If that path
is dead (tunnel up but resolver unreachable), the machine ends up "connected
but nothing resolves" — the classic failure that forces a manual adapter
restart. This module gives a cheap yes/no answer to "can the system resolve
names right now?" used in two places:

  * connect-time gate (controller): after raising the tunnel and clearing the
    physical DNS, confirm resolution works before committing; roll back if not.
  * runtime watchdog (GUI): periodically re-check; trigger a bounded self-heal
    on a sustained outage.

Design rules:
  * NEVER raises — every public function returns a bool. Callers must be able
    to treat a probe as advisory and never have it crash a connect/heal path.
  * Bounded wall-clock — getaddrinfo can hang far past socket timeouts on a
    broken resolver, so each lookup runs in a worker thread we abandon on
    timeout instead of trusting the C library to honour a deadline.
  * Uses the OS resolver (socket.getaddrinfo), so it exercises the exact same
    path real traffic uses — including whichever interface currently owns DNS.
