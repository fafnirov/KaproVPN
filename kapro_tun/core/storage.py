"""Persistent storage for configs, the direct-routing sites list, and settings.

Privacy: on Windows, configs.json is DPAPI-encrypted at rest (only the
current user account can read it). load_configs() transparently handles
both encrypted and legacy plaintext files — opening an old pre-1.8.0
file still works, and the next save flips it to encrypted form.

On macOS/Linux (v1.16.12+) configs are AES-256-GCM encrypted with a key
held in the OS keystore (Keychain / Secret Service) — see secrets_store.
Where no keystore is available (headless Linux) they fall back to
plaintext, protected by file permissions only, same as ~/.ssh/config.

What's NOT encrypted: sites.json (just domain names — not secret), and
settings.json (mostly preferences, but subscription_url IS a secret —
treated as such; we move it OUT of settings.json into the encrypted
configs.json blob for users who care).
