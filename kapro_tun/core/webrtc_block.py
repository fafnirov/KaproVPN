"""Firewall-based WebRTC leak protection — blocks STUN UDP traffic.

The leak: WebRTC (the browser P2P API behind Google Meet, Jitsi,
Discord-web, many web-video features) uses ICE/STUN to discover the
peer's network topology. The client opens a UDP socket to a public
STUN server (stun.l.google.com, etc.) which echoes back the client's
public IP. Any JavaScript on the page — not just video apps, ANY page —
can call `RTCPeerConnection`, harvest the candidates, and learn the
user's real public IP. Even with a perfectly working VPN.

Why a VPN doesn't auto-fix it:

  - HTTP-proxy mode tunnels TCP only. UDP (including STUN) goes
    directly out the physical NIC → real IP exposed.
  - TUN mode tunnels both, so STUN echoes back the VPN-exit IP
    instead of the real one. But "defence in depth" still wants
    the STUN block — protects against a TUN-bypass route the
    user accidentally configured, against malware running outside
    the tunnel, etc.

The block: a single Windows Firewall rule denying outbound UDP to the
known STUN service ports. STUN's well-known ports are tightly
standardised — the spec (RFC 5389) defines 3478 (plain) and 5349
(STUNS / DTLS). Google's web stack also publishes on 19302 and
19305-19309. Blocking these ports is enough to break all browser
WebRTC NAT-traversal without touching DNS (53), HTTPS (443), or
anything else the user actually wants to do.

Limits / known gotchas:

  - Native apps with embedded STUN on custom ports (Discord native
    voice, Zoom client, MS Teams) keep working — they don't use the
    well-known ports. Browser-based Discord/Teams DOES use them
    though, so web-Discord video CAN break. Documented in the
    Settings page warning.
  - We don't block TURN (relay over TLS:443) because that's
    indistinguishable from normal HTTPS traffic — you'd have to
    blacklist every TURN server's IP, which moves constantly.
    TURN doesn't leak the client IP though, only relays packets —
    so it's a different threat model.

Lifecycle mirrors ipv6_block (v1.11):

  - Installed at connect (if settings.webrtc_leak_protection)
  - Removed on graceful disconnect
  - Orphan rule from a crashed prior run cleaned at app startup

Requires admin. Silent skip if non-admin (defence-in-depth, won't
break the connect flow).

Future work:

  - macOS via `pfctl` anchor (block proto udp to any port {3478, 5349,
    19302, 19305:19309})
  - Linux via nftables (similar single-line rule)
