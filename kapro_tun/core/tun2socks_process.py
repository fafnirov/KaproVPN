"""Run tun2socks as a managed subprocess (cross-platform).

tun2socks creates the OS-level TUN device and forwards all IP traffic
from it into xray's SOCKS5 inbound. Combined with default-route changes,
this gives system-wide tunneling for every app (Telegram, Steam, games).

Per-OS device specification:
  Windows  -device wintun://KaproTun    (uses WinTUN driver, dll alongside)
  macOS    -device utun                 (let kernel auto-assign utunN)
  Linux    -device tun://kaprotun       (we choose the name, kernel creates it)

The interface naming is what we look up later via the platform's route
manager to set IP / metric / DNS on it.
