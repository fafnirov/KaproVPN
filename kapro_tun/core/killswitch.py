"""Firewall-based kill-switch — blocks all outbound traffic when the
tunnel is down so packets can't leak via the real interface.

How it works on Windows:

  At connect-time (when settings.kill_switch is True), we install
  three Windows Firewall rules using netsh advfirewall:

    1. KaproTUN-killswitch-block   Block ALL outbound traffic.
    2. KaproTUN-killswitch-allow-lan  Allow outbound to RFC1918 +
       loopback + link-local. So local network printers, NAS, router
       UI, AirPlay etc. keep working.
    3. KaproTUN-killswitch-allow-xray  Allow outbound from xray.exe
       specifically — that's the only process whose traffic SHOULD
       reach the public internet (it'll wrap everything in proxy/
       VLESS/Trojan/etc and send to the VPN server).

  Windows Firewall rule precedence: "block" wins over "allow" of the
  same scope, but more-specific allows win over broad blocks. So:
    - Random app tries to reach 1.2.3.4:443 → matches Block-all → DROP.
    - Same app instead asks xray (via SOCKS or system proxy) → xray
      then makes the outbound → matches Allow-xray-program → PASS.
    - Random app tries to reach 192.168.1.5 → matches Allow-lan → PASS.

If xray crashes mid-session, the rules STAY in place. Result:
  - Browser timeout instead of silent leak to real ISP
  - User notices, opens KaproTUN, reconnects → xray restarts,
    everything works again

Cleanup paths:
  - Graceful disconnect: rules removed
  - Crash/kill of KaproTUN: rules stay, but main.py's startup cleanup
    removes them on next launch (same pattern as orphan-killer)

Requires admin. The controller gates on admin.is_admin() before
activating kill-switch — without elevation, we silently skip
(non-admin users get a settings hint instead).
