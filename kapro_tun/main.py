    Anything else with xray.exe or tun2socks.exe in its image name is
    an orphan from a previous crashed KaproTUN run, holding file
    handles that block the next download/start. Kill them.

    Why this matters in practice: on Windows, an open file handle in
    a running process makes the file un-deletable AND un-overwritable.
    A fresh download of xray.exe over an orphaned-but-running copy
    fails with `PermissionError [Errno 13]`, which surfaces as
