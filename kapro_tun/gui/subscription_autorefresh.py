"""Background subscription auto-refresher.

Periodically re-fetches the user's saved subscription URL and silently
merges new servers into the configs list. Lets users forget that
KaproTUN exists between paying their provider — when they next launch
the app (or just leave it running), the list is current.

Safety: this is ADDITIVE-ONLY. We never delete configs. Why:

  - Subscription fetches can transiently fail (DPI hit, provider
    maintenance, expired API key). An "authoritative replace" would
    nuke the user's known-good servers on a temporary glitch.
  - Users sometimes add a non-subscription server manually alongside
    their provider's list. We don't tag origin, so we can't tell
    "this came from the sub" from "user pasted this themselves".

Worst case: the user accumulates dead servers. They can clean those
up by hand in the configs picker — much better than losing their
working server to a flaky network minute.
