"""Single-instance enforcement via QLocalServer (Windows named-pipe).

Why: if the user double-taps the desktop shortcut, opens from Start Menu
while the tray icon is still alive, or fires up the auto-start launch
in parallel with a manual one, we'd end up with two KaproTUN.exe
processes — both racing for the same xray port (2080), both trying to
create a TUN interface called "KaproTun", both fighting the system-proxy
registry. None of that is recoverable; better to detect early.

Pattern: try to connect to a named pipe that the primary instance owns.
If the connection succeeds, we're the second instance — write "show" so
the primary brings its window forward, then exit. If the connection
fails, no primary exists; we become it by listening on the same name.
