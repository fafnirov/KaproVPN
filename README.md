[English](README.md) · [Русский](README.ru.md)

Desktop proxy client (Windows) with built-in **split routing for Russian sites**.
Built on top of [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core).

---

### ⬇️ Download

Grab the latest **[`KaproVPN-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN/releases/latest)**
(~100 MB, Windows x64, no Python required). Run it — branded installer
walks you through: Welcome → Install → Done. Creates Start Menu and
Desktop shortcuts, registers in Programs & Features. Installs per-user
to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\KaproVPN\` — no admin required for install.

Once installed, right-click the shortcut → "Run as administrator" for TUN mode
(tunnels every app — Telegram, Steam, games — through the proxy).

---

## What it does

A GUI for proxy/VPN connections (Trojan, VLESS with REALITY and XHTTP, VMess,
Shadowsocks) with one extra trick: domains in a configurable list — Russian
banks, government services, marketplaces, etc. — bypass the proxy and go
directly through your real IP. Everything else routes through the proxy server.

## Why

When a user in Russia connects through a foreign proxy, services like Sberbank,
gosuslugi.ru, Ozon and many others refuse to work — they geofence to Russian
IPs. Switching the VPN off every time you need to pay a bill is annoying.
This tool keeps the proxy on for the open Internet and lets Russian services
see your real address.

## Features

- Parses share URLs in the standard formats:
  `trojan://`, `vless://` (including **REALITY** and **XHTTP** transport),
  `vmess://`, `ss://`
- Two connection modes:
  - **HTTP-proxy** (default, no admin) — works for browsers only
  - **TUN** (needs admin) — tunnels all apps system-wide, including Telegram,
    Steam, games. Uses bundled tun2socks + WinTUN driver
- Downloads `xray.exe`, `tun2socks.exe`, `wintun.dll` automatically on first
  use (~30 MB total)
- Editable list of "always direct" domains (108 entries by default — banks,
  госуслуги, marketplaces, media…)
- PySide6 GUI with dark theme, AmneziaVPN-style single-screen layout
- Live Xray-core log panel for troubleshooting

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11 (x64)
- ~80 MB total free disk space (~57 MB exe + ~25 MB for Xray + tun2socks + WinTUN)
- Admin rights *only* if you want TUN mode (everything tunneled). HTTP-proxy
  mode works without admin and tunnels just the browser.

## Install & run

### Option 1 — Installer (recommended)

Download **[`KaproVPN-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN/releases/latest)**,
run it, click Install. Done.

### Option 2 — From source (for development / contributing)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN.git
cd KaproVPN
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Or, to build your own installer locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
pyinstaller KaproVPN.spec          # → dist/KaproVPN.exe (portable, embedded into installer)
pyinstaller KaproVPN-Setup.spec    # → dist/KaproVPN-Setup.exe (final installer)
```

On first launch the app downloads the latest Xray-core release into
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\KaproVPN\xray\`. Same path for tun2socks + wintun.dll
(if TUN mode is enabled).

## How it works

1. You paste a share URL (e.g. `vless://…`).
2. The app parses it and generates an Xray-core JSON config with routing rules:
   - domains from your "direct" list → `freedom` outbound (your real IP)
   - everything else → proxy outbound (the parsed URL)
3. `xray.exe` starts as a subprocess and listens on `127.0.0.1:2080` (HTTP)
   and `:2081` (SOCKS5).
4. Windows system proxy is pointed at port 2080.
5. Any application that respects the system proxy (browsers, Office, most
   desktop apps) now follows the routing rules.

## Limitations

- Windows only for now (route + proxy code is Windows-specific; the rest
  is cross-platform).
- No Hysteria2 support yet — Xray-core doesn't speak that protocol. A
  second-engine (sing-box) path is on the roadmap.
- No subscription URL import yet (planned).
- TUN mode does IPv4 only — IPv6 traffic may leak outside the tunnel.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. A few directions where help is especially useful:

- Hysteria2 support via a second engine (sing-box)
- TUN mode (so games and any app are tunneled, not just HTTP-proxy-aware ones)
- Linux / macOS port
- Subscription URL importer (base64-list URLs)
- System tray icon
- Latency / health-check pings per config
