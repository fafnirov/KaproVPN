### ⬇️ Download

Latest stable release — pick the file for your OS:

| OS | File | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| **Windows 10 / 11 (x64)** | [`KaproVPN-Setup.exe`](https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN/releases/latest) | Per-user install, no admin needed |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon)** | [`KaproVPN-macOS-arm64.dmg`](https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN/releases/latest) | Drag into Applications |
| **Linux (x64)** | [`KaproVPN-Linux-x64.AppImage`](https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN/releases/latest) | `chmod +x` and run |

TUN mode (tunnel every app system-wide, including Telegram / Steam / games)
needs admin/root rights. HTTP-proxy mode works without admin and tunnels
browser traffic.

#### ⚠️ Windows SmartScreen warning on first run

When you run `KaproVPN-Setup.exe`, Windows Defender SmartScreen may say
**"Windows protected your PC"** and refuse to launch. This happens because
we don't pay Microsoft $300/year for an EV code-signing certificate —
this is a free OSS project, not a commercial one. To proceed:

1. Click **"More info"** on the SmartScreen dialog
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

You only do this once per release. macOS may show a similar
**"unidentified developer"** prompt — right-click the `.dmg` → **Open** →
**Open** to bypass (one-time).

## What it does

GUI for proxy/VPN connections (Trojan, VLESS with REALITY and XHTTP, VMess,
Shadowsocks, Hysteria2) with one extra trick: domains in a configurable
list **bypass the proxy** and connect directly through your real IP.
Everything else routes through the proxy server.

## Why

When you connect through a foreign proxy, some services refuse to work
because they geofence to a specific country (banks, government portals,
marketplaces). Switching the VPN off every time you need to use one is
annoying. KaproVPN keeps the proxy on for the open Internet and lets
the sites in your direct list see your real address.

## Features

- 🔌 **All major share-URL formats** — `vless://` (incl. REALITY & XHTTP),
  `trojan://`, `vmess://`, `ss://`, `hysteria2://`
- 📥 **Subscription URL import** — paste a single URL, get all configs
  from your provider. Background auto-refresh every 12 h (additive-only,
  never deletes working configs).
- 🛡 **Real firewall kill-switch** — if the proxy dies, Windows Firewall
  blocks all non-`xray.exe` outbound. No silent leak of your real IP.
- 🔁 **Auto-reconnect** — transparently retries up to 3 times with
  backoff if Xray crashes mid-session.
- 🔒 **Encrypted-on-disk configs** — Windows DPAPI (same mechanism Chrome
  uses for saved passwords). Old plaintext configs auto-upgrade on first
  launch.
- 🌐 **Two connection modes** —
  - **HTTP-proxy** (default, no admin) — browser + system-proxy-aware apps
  - **TUN** (admin/root) — tunnels every app, including games and Telegram.
    Uses bundled tun2socks + WinTUN driver.
- ✏️ **Editable "always direct" domain list** — 108 sensible defaults
  (banks, government portals, marketplaces, media).
- 📡 **Tray quick-connect** — top-3 fastest configs by ping in the tray
  menu, one click to switch.
- 🌍 **EN / RU localisation** — auto-detected from system locale,
  switchable in Settings.
- 📊 **Live traffic stats + per-config ping** in the UI.
- 🔄 **In-app auto-update** — checks GitHub Releases, downloads, installs.

## Privacy

Short version: **we don't collect anything.** No analytics, no telemetry,
no remote logging. Configs are encrypted on disk on Windows. Xray's
access-log is explicitly disabled in our generated config (no per-domain
log on your disk). The optional download mirror on `kaprovpn.pro/files`
keeps nginx access-logs for 7 days then deletes them; the GitHub
fallback is always available.

disclosure address.

## Requirements

| OS | Minimum |
|----|---------|
| Windows | 10 / 11 (x64) |
| macOS | 12+ (Apple Silicon) |
| Linux | glibc 2.31+ (Ubuntu 20.04+ and equivalents) |

Disk: ~80 MB total (~57 MB app + ~25 MB for Xray + tun2socks + WinTUN
downloaded on first connect).

## Install & run

### Option 1 — Installer (recommended)

Download the right file for your OS from
[Releases](https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN/releases/latest) and run it.

### Option 2 — From source (for development / contributing)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fafnirov/KaproVPN.git
cd KaproVPN
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

To build your own installer locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
pyinstaller KaproVPN.spec          # → dist/KaproVPN.exe (portable, embedded into installer)
pyinstaller KaproVPN-Setup.spec    # → dist/KaproVPN-Setup.exe (Windows installer)
```

On first launch, the app downloads the latest Xray-core release into
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\KaproVPN\xray\` (Windows) or `~/.local/share/KaproVPN/`
(macOS / Linux). Same paths for tun2socks + wintun.dll on Windows.

## How it works

1. You paste a share URL (e.g. `vless://…`) or a subscription URL.
2. The app parses it and generates an Xray-core JSON config with split
   routing rules:
   - domains from your "direct" list → `freedom` outbound (your real IP)
   - everything else → proxy outbound (the parsed URL)
   - public DNS resolvers and port 53 → always direct (anti-DNS-leak)
3. `xray.exe` starts as a subprocess and listens on `127.0.0.1:2080` (HTTP)
   and `:2081` (SOCKS5).
4. **HTTP mode**: the OS HTTP-proxy is pointed at port 2080.
   **TUN mode**: tun2socks creates a virtual network adapter and forwards
   every packet through `127.0.0.1:2081`, then xray routes by rule.
5. If Xray dies unexpectedly, auto-reconnect retries. If the firewall
   kill-switch is enabled, traffic stays blocked until reconnect or
   explicit disconnect — no silent leak.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. The most useful directions right now:

- **Native code-signing on macOS** — if you have a paid Apple Developer
  account, a CONTRIBUTING patch that wires up codesigning + notarytool in
  the GitHub Actions build would let macOS users skip the
  "unidentified developer" Gatekeeper prompt.
- **Android port** — there's a skeleton in `android/` (VPNService + TUN +
  config bridge to libv2ray.aar), needs UI polish and connect flow.
- **IPv6 in TUN mode** — currently IPv4-only; IPv6 traffic can leak
  outside the tunnel.
- **More languages** — `kapro_vpn/core/i18n.py` is dict-based, easy to add.
- **Linux Wayland support** — works on X11/XWayland; native Wayland needs
  PySide6 platform-plugin tweaks.

## Roadmap

- Crash-report opt-in (user-initiated log upload, no auto-collect)
- Public-IP/country indicator after connect (so you see proof the tunnel
  is up)
- macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret equivalent of DPAPI for configs
